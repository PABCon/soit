# SóIT — working notes

Transparency-first IT job board for Portugal. **`docs/mvp-build-spec.md` is the
source of truth** — read the relevant section before changing behaviour, and
update it *first* when adding a feature (§12.5).

## The two rules that define the product (§1)
1. Every listing shows a salary range. Posting without one is blocked.
2. Every employer is a verified business entity (NIF, §5.7).

## Conventions
- **Brand is `SóIT`; every machine-readable identifier is ASCII `soit`** (§1) —
  npm forbids accented package names and an IDN punycodes to `xn--sit-zma.pt`.
- **Bilingual PT + EN, both locale-prefixed** (`/pt/…`, `/en/…`, §2.2). Every
  string goes through `next-intl` — never hard-code UI text. Run
  `npm run check:i18n` before committing; it fails on catalogue drift.
- Import `Link`, `redirect`, `usePathname`, `useRouter` from `@/i18n/navigation`,
  never from `next/link` or `next/navigation` — they must be locale-aware.
- **Salary is never rendered ad hoc.** Use `@/components/Salary`, which always
  shows amount + period + months + gross + employment type (§5.2).
- Two surfaces, one database (§2.1): route groups `(candidate)` (public, SEO
  critical) and `(console)` at `/recruit` (behind login, `noindex`).
- **RLS is the security model** (§6). Never filter by tenant in client code.
  Privileged cross-tenant writes use the service role key, server-side only.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` · `npm run build`
- `npm run check` — i18n parity + lint + typecheck
- `npm run test` — vitest (currently just the NIF validator, §14 testing floor)

## Build sequence
§14 of the spec. **Step 1 (skeleton + i18n + shells + tokens) is done.**
**Step 2 (schema, RLS, storage buckets) is done and verified** against the
live Supabase project ("SO IT", ref `bzwavosbvarvdhsogxqt`) — see
`supabase/migrations/README.md`. `.env.local` holds real project credentials.

**Step 3 (auth + employer verification) is done**: email/password + social
(Google/GitHub/LinkedIn — wired, inert until OAuth credentials are added in
the Supabase dashboard) registration and login for both roles, NIF layer-1
validation (`src/lib/nif.ts`, exhaustively tested), async VIES verification
with lazy retry (no cron — Vercel Hobby's minimum interval is daily), and
role-split landing (§6.4). See `src/lib/auth/complete-registration.ts` for
the profile-creation/claiming logic and `docs/mvp-build-spec.md` §5.7/§6.4/§9
for the rules it implements. Verified directly against the live database
(admin client, both role branches, idempotency) — see git history for the
verification transcript. Known gaps, not blockers: production's
`https://soit.vercel.app` isn't yet in the Supabase Auth redirect allowlist
(only `soit-soit.vercel.app` patterns are — add it in the dashboard before
relying on employer/candidate registration in production); Supabase's
default email sender is rate-limited enough to make repeated local testing
slow.

Next: step 4 — employer console (My job ads, Add job advertisement, Company
Profile editor, publish gated on `verification_status = 'verified'`).
